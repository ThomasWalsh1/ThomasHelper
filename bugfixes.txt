After creating this project in a project folder template, there are some issues that still need to be worked out.
None of the Chrome opening buttons are performing their functions correctly.
p.WaitFor() may be the issue, because after chrome closes, the function then begins to run.

FIX - Put code for mouse movement after the bar does its round up.
